# Linux Kernel Hacking

Experimentation with Linux kernel modules to try and learn more about how the kernel works.

Ongoing series of blog posts on rootkit techniques can be found [here](https://xcellerator.github.io/).

Educational purposes only.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 16.04, via Vagrant - should work on most kernels.

> Updated to work with kernels 5.7+

分支基于[xcellerator大佬](https://xcellerator.github.io/)的库 只是添加了我学习过程中复制粘贴的代码，抱歉我不是一个dev而是一个paste
